1). What is Computer?

Coming from the latin word "computare", the computer is a device that processes data and performs tasks according to instruction, which are also called "programs".

(https://www.webopedia.com/definitions/computer)

2). What are the essential parts of Computer?

The most Essential parts (inside the System Unit) being the:

-Processor (CPU)-Is often called the "brain" of the computer, it handles all the processes that the computer gives.
-Memory (RAM)-Also known as "Random Access Memory", this is where data is stored temporarily, and helps boot up programs more quickly.
-Motherboard-It is a circuit board that holds all the components together.
-Storage (ssd or hdd)-It is the component in which data is stored permanently(until deleted).
-Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)-It is a component that makes it possible for the computer to generate "higher end visuals" that is commonly found in (Games, Editing Softwares, etc.)

While essential parts (outside the System Unit) are:

-Monitor-Is where the text, images, and videos are going to be displayed.
-Keyboard-A part of the computer in which the user is allowed to type letters to form words.
-Mouse-A part of the computer in which allows the user to move the cursor around the screen to access certain programs/files.
-Web camera-Allows the user to take photos and videos.
-Microphone-Allows the user to record sounds.
